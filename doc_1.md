Documentation for Question 1

(a) Data Structure  
In this code, stack is used to store brackets as we go through the expression.  
If an opening brackets like (, {, or [, are found, we put it in the stack.  
We check if it matches the last one we stored, If we find a closing bracket like ), }, or ],  
When all brackets have a match, the stack is empty in the end,meaning the expression is balanced.

(b) Functions  
- push: adds a bracket to the top of the stack.  
- pop: removes the top bracket from the stack.  
- isMatching: checks if an opening and closing bracket go together.  
- isBalanced: goes through the expression and uses the stack to check if itâ€™s balanced.

(c) main()  
Three expressions are checked to see if the brackets are balanced.  
After each test, It prints if it is balanced or not.

(d) Sample Output  
Expression 1 is not balanced  
Expression 2 is not balanced  
Expression 3 is balanced
