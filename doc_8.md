Documentation for Question 8

(a) Data Structure  
An array is used to store random numbers between 1 to 1000.  
User chooses he number of elements during program run. 
The user selects the sorting algorithm they want to use.  
We also count the number of comparisons and swaps that happened during sorting.

(b) Functions  
- bubbleSort: Method where two numbers are compared at a time and swaps them if needed.  
  The process is repeated until entire array is sorted.  
 Comparisons and swaps made during sorting are counted.

(c) main()  
The user is asked how many random numbers they want.  
Those numbers are randomly generated and displayed.  
The numbers are sorted using Bubble Sort and show the sorted list.  
The total number of comparisons and swaps that happened during sorting are printed.

(d) Sample Output  
Enter how many numbers: 5  
Before Sorting:  
672 24 315 89 498  
Sorting using Bubble Sort...  
After Sorting:  
24 89 315 498 672  
Comparisons: 10  
Swaps: 6
